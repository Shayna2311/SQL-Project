# SQL-Project

## Objective
In this project, the objective was to answer the following 2 questions:
1. What is the overall average import and export of each type of energy product in Singapore from 2005 - 2023?

2. How has Singapore been performing in terms of energy consumption?

## Dataset
We utilised 2 sources of data:
1. Data on Energy by Our World in Data  
   retrieved from https://github.com/owid/energy-data

2. Singapore Energy Consumption  
   retrieved from https://www.ema.gov.sg/singapore-energy-statistics/Ch03/index3

## Approach
There is a positive correlation between economic growth (measured by GDP) and the energy demands of an economy (Faisal, 2017). Hence, to ensure a fair comparison, we selected countries with an average GDP that does not vary more than 10% from the average GDP of Singapore from 2008 - 2018. Based on the 10% threshold, we obtained the following 6 comparable references:
